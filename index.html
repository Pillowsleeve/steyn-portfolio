            You might have heard of the phrase: "practise makes perfect".
            I believe in this phrase but people often don't know that the root of practise is...
            Experience! By experiencing certain situations mentally and or physically your brain will automatically
            remember them.
            Ofcourse not every brain can instantly remember every single bit of data that it received.
            That is why we must experience this situation multiple times to really get to know it.

            On this site, you will read all about me and my experiences with school,
            projects and my learning process but also about my experiences with life, friends, family and myself.

        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            My name is Steyn van Bolhuis. I am 18 years old and study at Rotterdam Hogeschool: Creative Media and Game
            Technologies.
            Here I learn programming in HTML, CSS, Javascript and eventually in C#.
            I enroll here because of my past experiences with programming, gaming, drawing and web design.
            I'll tell you about these experiences later. In the Netherlands our school system consists of three
            different schools.
            Toddles first go to preschool but as we call it: "basic-school".
            Around the age of twelve you go to highschool or "middle-school".
            This is where you are put into different categories based on your "intelligence".
            The usual categories are MAVO, HAVO and VWO.
            I studied at a school called Melanchthon Schiebroek where I did VWO for
            5 years before going to HAVO in my last year where I also graduated at.
            Now I am planning to go to a university after my first year here.

            So, let me tell you more about my past experiences.
